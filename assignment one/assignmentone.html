       <strong> BIOGRAPHY </strong>
       <div><p>
        My name is Liberty Fakolade and I've just enrolled for the AltSchool program for Tinyuka semester. 
        I chose the Cloud Engineering track which is under School of Engineering because I've been at Cloud 
        Computing for more than 2 years and haven't made any significant progress. 
        <p>
        Getting to know about AltSchool made me reassess my journey afterwhich I came to an honest conclusion that
        I would need a structured learning system which AltSchool provides. My goal for joining this program is to have hands-on experience with cloud engineering tools
        enough to get my cloud engineering career started. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm committing 40+ hours weekly to this goal and challenging myself to stretch beyond what I think is my limit.
        </p>

       <strong>WHY I JOINED THE PROGRAM</strong>
       <p>
        <strong><em>I had no choice but to join the Alt School program for the followng reasons:</em></strong>
       <ul>
        <li>As earlier mentioned, I had no choice.</li>
        <li>Cloud Engineering must obey by force</li>
        <li>I challenged myself to start and complete something</li>
        <li>I've parted ways with mediocrity. It's time to skill up.</li>
        <li>To learn, learn, learn</li>
        <li>I can't continue like this</li>
        <li>To solve cloud computing and cloud engineering problems across industries</li>
        <li>To become a cloud consultant</li>
       </ul>
       </p><hr>

       <strong>GOALS</strong><p>
        <strong><em>Here are my reasons for joining Alt School Cloud Engineering program:</em></strong> 
       <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Desperation: </strong> I know they say desperation is never a good reason for doing anything but I'll be honest, I'm very desperate.
            I've been at this Cloud thing for years and it's finally time to learn this stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Income: </strong> Make insane money from this. Simple and short! 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Skill Issue:</strong> I want to be extremely good at something. I want to be so good that I can't be ignored. 
            This is the time (I'm careful not to say only time) I have to prove to myself that I can commit to something, get
            through with it by completing it with excellence and knowing that I gave it all it takes.
         </li>
       </ol>
